# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This project builds a classifier for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), designed to identify emotions from human speech. Recognizing human emotion from voice signals is a critical aspect of speech processing, relevant to a range of applications from customer service to vehicle safety systems.

## Why Speech Emotion Recognition?
Speech Emotion Recognition is a key component in understanding human interactions and reactions. Here are some real-world applications:
1. **Customer Service**: SER helps classify customer calls by emotional state, aiding in performance evaluations and identifying dissatisfied customers.
2. **Safety in Vehicles**: In-car systems can monitor driversâ€™ emotions, enhancing safety by detecting states like stress or anger.
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: From virtual assistants to health monitoring, SER provides insights into user moods, improving responsiveness.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes voice samples labeled by emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and others. This project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze these samples and achieve effective emotion classification.

## Project Structure
- **Data Processing**: Preparing and processing voice samples.
- **Model Training**: Building and training a deep learning model to classify emotions.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy and fine-tuning for optimal performance.
